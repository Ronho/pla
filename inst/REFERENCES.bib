 abstract = {Principal loading analysis is a dimension reduction method that discards variables which have only a small distorting effect on the covariance matrix. We complement principal loading analysis and propose to rather use a mix of both, the correlation and covariance matrix instead. Further, we suggest to use rescaled eigenvectors and provide updated algorithms for all proposed changes.},

@misc{Bauer.10.07.2020,
 abstract = {This paper proposes a tool for dimension reduction where the dimension of the original space is reduced: a Principal Loading Analysis (PLA). PLA is a tool to reduce dimensions by discarding variables. The intuition is that variables are dropped which distort the covariance matrix only by a little. Our method is introduced and an algorithm for conducting PLA is provided. Further, we give bounds for the noise arising in the sample case.},
